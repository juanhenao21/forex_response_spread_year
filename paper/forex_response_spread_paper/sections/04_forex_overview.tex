\section{Foreign exchange market overview}\label{sec:forex_overview}

The foreign exchange market is the most volatile, liquid and largest of all
financial markets
\cite{forex_liquidity,info_forex,forex_market_micro,intraday_forex}, and it has
a paramount importance for the world economy. It affects employment, inflation,
international capital flows, among others \cite{forex_structure}. The foreign
exchange market is a decentralized market without a common trading floor
\cite{info_forex,forex_market_micro,forex_structure,teach_spread}

The term pip (Price Increment Point) is commonly used in the foreign exchange
market instead of tick. The precise definition of a pip is a matter of
convention. Usually, it refers to the incremental value in the fifth non-zero
digit position from the left. It is not related to the position of the decimal
point. For example, one pip in the exchange rate USD/JPY of 124.21 would be
0.01, while one pip for EUR/USD of 1.1021 would be 0.0001
