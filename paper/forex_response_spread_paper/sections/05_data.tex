\section{Data set}\label{sec:data_set}

The spot foreign exchange financial data was obtained from
\href{www.histdata.com}{HistData.com}. We use a tick-by-tick database in
generic ASCII format for different years and currency pairs. This tick-by-tick
data is sampled for each transaction. The data comprises the date time stamp
(YYYYMMDD HHMMSSNNN), the best bid and best ask quotes prices in the Eastern
Standard Time (EST) time zone. With both best bid and best ask quotes it is
easy to compute the pip bid-ask spread of the data. No information about the
size of each transaction is provided. Also, the identity of the participants is
not given. Furthermore, trading volumes in spot foreign exchange market are not
aggregated and the only volumes that are possible to find are the Broker
Specific Volumes. Therefore, the data provider decided to remove the volume
information from the delivered data.

One aim of this paper is to compute the price response functions in two
different time scales: trade time scale and physical time scale. We give a
complete description on how the scales are defined in Sect.
\ref{sec:time_scale}. Regarding the data for this definitions, for the trade
time scale we use the data as it is, considering that it is sampled for each
transaction. On the physical time scale, for each exchange rate, we process the
irregularly spaced raw data to construct second-by-second price series, each
containing 86,400 observations per day. For every second, the midpoint of best
bid and ask quotes are used to construct one-second log-returns.

Another goal in this paper is to compare the price response functions in
different calendar years to see the differences and similarities along time.
To analyze the price response functions in Sect. \ref{sec:response_functions},
we select the seven major currency pairs (see Table \ref{tab:majors}) in three
different years: 2008, 2014 and 2019.

Additionally, we analyze the pip bid-ask spread impact in price response
functions (Sect. \ref{sec:spread_impact}). We select 46 currency pairs in three
different years (2011, 2015 and 2019). The selected pairs are listed in
Appendix \ref{app:fx_pairs_spread}.

The selection of the calendar years to be analyzed was made considering the
availability of the data, the completeness of the time series and the option to
have a constant gap between the years.

In order to avoid overnight effects and any artifact due to the opening and
closing of the foreign exchange market, we systematically discard the first
ten and the last ten minutes of trading in a given week
\cite{Bouchaud_2004,my_paper_response_financial,Wang_2016_cross,large_prices_changes,spread_changes_affect}.
Therefore, we only consider trades of the same week from Sunday 19:10:00 to
Friday 16:50:00 New York local time. We will refer to this interval of time as
the ``market time".
