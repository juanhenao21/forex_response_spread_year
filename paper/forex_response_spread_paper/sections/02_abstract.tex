\begin{abstract}
      We carry out a detailed large-scale data analysis of price response
      functions in the spot foreign exchange market for different years and
      different time scales. Such response functions provide quantitative
      information on the deviation from Markovian behavior. The price response
      functions show an increase to a maximum followed by a slow decrease as
      the time lag grows, in trade time scale and in physical time scale, for
      all analyzed years. Furthermore, we use a price increment point (pip)
      bid-ask spread definition to group different foreign exchange pairs and
      analyze the impact of the spread in the price response functions. We find
      that large pip spreads have a stronger impact on the response. This is
      similar to what has been found in stock markets.
