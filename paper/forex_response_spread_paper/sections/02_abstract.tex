\abstract{
      In spite of the considerable interest, a thorough statistical analysis of
      foreign exchange markets was hampered by limited access to data. This
      changed, and nowadays such data analyses are possible down to the level
      of ticks and over long time scales. We analyze price response functions
      in the foreign exchange market for different years and different time
      scales. Such response functions provide quantitative information on the
      deviation from Markovian behavior. The price response functions show an
      increase to a maximum followed by a slow decrease as the time lag grows,
      in trade time scale and in physical time scale, for all analyzed years.
      Furthermore, we use a price increment point (pip) spread definition
      to group different foreign exchange pairs and analyze the impact of the
      spread in the price response functions. We found that large pip spreads
      have stronger impact on the response. This is similar to what has been
      found in stock markets.
